Summary:
  When calling Question.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5028cd5b98de5a4e0800003f ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5028cd5b98de5a4e0800003f.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
